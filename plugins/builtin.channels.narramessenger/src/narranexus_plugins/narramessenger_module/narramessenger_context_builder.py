@description: Build execution context for NarraMessenger-triggered messages.

Inherits ``ChannelContextBuilderBase``. Post-Direct-Matrix migration
(Commit 7, 2026-07-02) the trigger reads raw ``m.room.message`` events
off ``/sync``; there is NO inline history or member roster on the
invocation payload — ``ParsedMessage.raw`` only carries the fields
``matrix_trigger._wrap_event`` populates (text / mxc_url / mimetype /
size / event_id / room_id / sender_id / server_ts).

Consequences for the abstract methods:
  - ``get_conversation_history`` → ``[]``. History is served by
    ChatModule's chat_history assembly during ``gather``
    (persisted turns + attachment markers all end up in the system
    prompt).
  - ``get_room_members`` → ``[]``. If a future turn actually needs a
    live roster, the agent calls ``narra_cli`` with
    ``room info --room-id <id> --members`` on demand. Baking the roster
    into every prompt is expensive and would duplicate what that command
    already returns per-agent-decision.

Only ``get_message_info`` still reads a bit of ``raw`` — the
``room_name`` from ``group_context.room.name`` (graceful ``""``
fallback when absent, which is the current default).

        Pre-Matrix (Gateway/polling) NarraMessenger shipped inline
        ``group_context.history_messages`` (group) / ``context`` (DM)
        in every invocation, and this method normalised them into the
        base's ``[{sender, timestamp, body}]`` shape so the
        ``## Conversation History`` slot in the channel prompt could
        carry a few rounds of context.

        Direct Matrix (Commit 7, 2026-07-02) removed that channel:

        fallback branch. The method now returns ``[]``
        unconditionally.

        The intended path is ChatModule's chat_history: past turns
        (including their attachments) are recalled from persisted
        messages during ``gather`` and rendered into the
        system prompt. Historical attachment markers are synthesised
        there via ``Attachment.markers_from_dicts``; the current
        turn's marker is appended at
        ``context_runtime.build_input_for_framework`` — same helper,
